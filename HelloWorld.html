	<p>Describe your path to becoming a photographer. 
	</p>
	<p> I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, and then went to Iowa for college. I was interested in social work, but my main focus was playing professional basketball. I had played basketball my whole life and received a partial scholarship for it. </p>
	<p class="bold">When did you decide to stop pursuing basketball professionally?
	</p>
	<p> Trying to play professional basketball is such a hard thing to do. I was playing Division III basketball, so I wasn’t at a super high level. Once I started trying out and seeing other athletes from around the world who had been trying to play professionally for years, I thought, “Oh, shit.” I tried out for the Iowa Energy, a D league team, and thought about getting an agent or trying to play overseas and move up from there, but it all fell apart. It was a lot to think about because I was the first person in my family to go to college. I liked social work and working with kids, but I had always imagined myself playing basketball. Basketball had been such a huge part of my life that it left a void once I stopped pursuing it professionally. That’s when I picked up a camera. I was just trying to find something to do with my time.</p>

<p>Was there an “Aha!” moment when you realized you could or wanted to seriously pursue photography?</p>
<p> With basketball, I was married to a process: I worked out, traveled, went to the gym all the time, and played a game, which was like a performance piece. I was so used to being busy all the time and photography went hand-in-hand with that lifestyle. Once I was in New York, I started meeting more creatives and people with jobs that I didn’t even know existed. I thought, “Oh, shit! People are making a living doing this?” That’s when I started taking photography more seriously and realized that it could be more than a hobby.</p>
